                At Greenes Family Farm, we are always around to take special care of our hens. Keeping their safety as a
                number one priority helps ensure the highest quality eggs. We get up bright and early to make sure our
                birds
                are happy and their needs are catered for. Our family walk among the flock paying close attention to
                them,
                making sure they have everything they need and are in good health. We are always on hand to open their
                pop
                holes so they can freely roam our fresh pastures.

            <p class="paraforabout" >
                At Greens Free Range Eggs, all our eggs are marketed as Extra Fresh. Each morning’s collection of eggs
                from
                our hens are taken to our on-farm packing centre where there are carefully hand checked and packed for
                you.
                We transport the eggs in our own vans each day to ensure they receive the extra fresh mark.

                The Greenes based on their family farm in Rockfield, Rathaspick, Rathowen, Co. Westmeath have been
                involved
                in
                farming and caring for the land for five generations, their believes have always been rooted in good
                farming
                practices and traditional methods insuring that quality products always reach the customer. In
                developing a
                superior
                quality free range eggs we wanted to insure that farming methods, animal welfare were of paramount
                importance, and
                in keeping with traditional farming methods as previous generations would have farmed.

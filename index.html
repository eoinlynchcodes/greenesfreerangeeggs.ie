                <h5 class="balsamiqsans greentext">Brain Health</h5>
                <p>One egg yolk has about 300 micrograms of choline, and important nutrient that helps to regulate the
                    brain, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. </p>

                <h5 class="balsamiqsans greentext">Vitamin Source</h5>
                <p>Egg whites are rich sources of selenium, vitamin D, B6, B12 and minerals such as zinc, iron, fat
                    soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and lecithin. Vitamin D is essential for bone growth, immunity and
                    much more..</p>

                <h5 class="balsamiqsans greentext">Protein and Amino Acids</h5>
                <p>Eggs contain about 6.30 grams of protein, making them one of the best food sources of protein. Eggs
